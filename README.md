# Tumour-Mutation-Clustering-Using-Divide-and-Conquer-Convex-Hull-Algorithm-
This project demonstrates how D&amp;C algorithms can be applied to cancer genomics by clustering tumour mutation data using convex hull algorithm. The aim is to visualize mutation patterns and identify tumor clusters for better understanding of carcinogensis
